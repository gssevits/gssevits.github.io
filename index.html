    <h1>My name is Gary Sevits
    </h1>
     <p>I am a student at Wake Tech in the IT-Networking program. I work for the City of Raleigh as a Signal Analyst. I am currently working on a team to develop and implement a traffic camera system focused on analytics and eventually AI. One of my favorite things to do is go hiking. I recently enjoyed hiking Calloway Peak at Grandfather Mountain.
