    <h1>My name is Gary Sevits
    </h1>
     <p>I'm enrolled in the IT-Networking program at Wake Tech and also work as a Signal Analyst for the City of Raleigh. Currently, I'm an active team member involved in the development and implementation of a cutting-edge traffic camera system with a primary focus on analytics and future AI integration. Hiking is one of my favorite pastimes, and I recently had an amazing experience hiking Calloway Peak at Grandfather Mountain.
